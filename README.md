This was one of my first projects using HTML and CSS. Here I learned how to structure a website, design it and make it adaptable for mobile devices, what we know as responsive design.

I used my cat as a reference for the page image, I tried to use dark colors for visual comfort, writing how my experience was in learning CSS and its versatility.

The content of the page is written in my native language, Spanish.
